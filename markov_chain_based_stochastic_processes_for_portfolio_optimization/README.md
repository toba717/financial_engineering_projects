# Markov Chain based Stochastic Processes for Portfolio Optimization

UCLA MATH 171 Winter 2023 (Final Overall Course Grade: In Progress)

Course Title: Stochastic Processes

Course Description: This course covers theory and applications of stochastic processes.  We begin with Markov chains and historical applications to games of chance.  We learn to calculate fundamental quantities and understand the limiting behavior of some Markov chains. We next consider the Poisson and renewal processes, with applications to queuing problems. For example, we can analyze the time a caller will wait on hold with customer service and the cost / benefits of queuing strategies for a company.  This analysis is simplified using approximations from the law of large numbers.  Finally, we consider continuous time Markov chains and martingales, with applications to finance.  Such processes arise as natural limits of the discrete Markov chains we have considered and provide fundamental tools to model asset prices in finance.  We discuss the financial concept of arbitrage and the related probabilistic concept of martingales (models of asset prices for which arbitrage is impossible).


## FINAL PROJECT

Stochastic processes are mathematical models that are used to describe random events or behavior over time. In finance, stochastic processes are particularly useful for modeling the random fluctuations in financial markets. One popular type of stochastic process used in finance is Markov Chains, which are a mathematical framework that allows us to model the transition probabilities between different states of a system.

The objective of our research paper is to explore the applications of stochastic processes, particularly Markov Chains, in portfolio optimization. Portfolio optimization is the process of constructing a portfolio of assets that maximizes expected returns while minimizing the risk of the investor. To achieve this objective, we plan to build a model using Markov Chains to quantify three states (bullish, neutral, or bearish) and ultimately determine which stocks have the highest probability of positive returns.

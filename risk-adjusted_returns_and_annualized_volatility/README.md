# risk-adjusted returns and annualized volatility

Risk-adjusted return is a measure of the return of an investment after adjusting for the risk involved. It is a way to compare the performance of investments with different levels of risk and can help investors make informed decisions about which investments align with their risk tolerance and investment goals.

I have assessed and exmamined various measures of risk-adjusted returns. I initially calculated the annualized volatility and computed and plotted the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Modigliani ratio, and the Calmar ratio utilizing max drawdown.

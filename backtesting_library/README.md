#backtesting_library

Backtesting is a process of evaluating a trading strategy or investment strategy using historical data to simulate how the strategy would have performed in the past. It involves taking a set of trading rules and applying them to historical market data to see how they would have performed over a specific period. 

I looked into the Backtesting Library and optimized specific parameters to achieve the best output result.

# VaR and CVaR

Value at Risk (VaR) is a measure of the risk of an investment. 
Furthermore, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), also known as Expected Shortfall (ES), is a measure of the expected loss of an investment beyond a certain level of loss, such as the VaR. 

In this repository, I looked into examining the VaR and the CVaR in a given monte carlo simulation. 
I assessed the risk that pertains to a given investment in a set timeframe.

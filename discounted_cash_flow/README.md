# discounted_cash_flow
The discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a financial method of valuing a security, company, or asset using the concept of time value of money and free cash flow.

In this project, I aim to analyze the DCF model and further implement it in Python. I generated multiple functions and tested the effectiveness looking into various companies in major sectors of the market.

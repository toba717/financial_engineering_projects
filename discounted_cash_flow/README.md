# discounted_cash_flow
The discounted cash flow (DCF) model is a financial valuation method that is used to estimate the intrinsic value of an investment by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them back to their present value using a required rate of return. It is a widely used technique for valuing assets, particularly in the field of finance and investing.
The DCF model involves estimating the future cash flows that an investment is expected to generate, and then discounting those cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate, also known as the required rate of return. The present value of the future cash flows is then used to estimate the intrinsic value of the investment.


In this project, I aim to analyze the DCF model and further implement it in Python. I generated multiple functions and tested the effectiveness of the model looking into various companies in major sectors of the market.

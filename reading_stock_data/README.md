# reading_stock_data

The first step in being able to analyze the market is pulling financial data into our code. Pandas Datareader is a Python library that allows users to easily access and extract data from a variety of online sources, including financial data from major exchanges and financial websites. It is built on top of the popular pandas library, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The pandas-datareader library provides a simple interface for downloading and accessing financial data from various sources, and allows users to easily manipulate and analyze the data using the familiar pandas data structures and functions. 

I then utilized Matplotlib and Plotly to derive meaningful information from the data. Plotly is a Python library that allows users to create interactive visualizations of data. It can be used to create various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and more. The plots created using Plotly are interactive, meaning that they can be zoomed, panned, and hovered over to display additional information. 

I implemented actual stock data from four companies in a selected time frame and looked at how the value of the stock changed over time. I have successfully achieved this through navigating through Pandas Datareader and Plotly.

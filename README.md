The Standard & Poor's 500 encompasses 500 corporations that have their stock publically listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Often times, it is regarded to greatly represent trends of the United State's global market as a whole.

In this project, I aim to generate a machine learning model to predict if we should buy the S&amp;P 500. Stock prices fluctuate greatly from day to day, minute to minute, and second to second. I will look into the S&P 500 dataset provided by yahoo finance to utilize valid predictors in constructing the model.

Constructed model utilizing Random Forest.
Generated prediction and backtesting function to access the accuracy of the model.

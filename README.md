# financial_engineering_projects

I have always been passionate about the intersection in finance and technology! 
I love applying my technical skills in the world of finance to generate a dynamic impact on the community.


This repository consists of the project that I have worked on that expands my horizon in the finance industry.


List of Projects:
- backtesting library
  - Incorporated backtesting library and optimized parameters
- black scholes method
  - Generated the overarching function for the black scholes formula and have tested with actual options
- discounted cash flow
  - Implemented the DCF method and assessed the fair value of multiple companies
- log returns and normality assumptions
  - Determined differences in simple and log return and checked normality assumptions through QQ plots and hypothesis tests
- markov chain based stochastic processes for portfolio optimization
  - Predicted probabilities of states through considering the following states:"bullish" "bearish" and "neutral" 
- monte carlo simulation 
  - Utilized the Monte Carlo method to simulate the performance of a stock portfolio
- plotting candlestick chart
  - Constructed a candlestick chart and the corresponding volume
- reading stock data
  - Navigated through Pandas Datareader and Plotly to derive insights on the market
- risk-adjusted returns and annualized volatility
  - Calculated the annualized volatility and  plotted the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Modigliani ratio, and the Calmar ratio utilizing max drawdown
- stock market prediction
  - Generated machine learning models to predict if we should buy the S&P 500
- value at risk and conditional value at risk
  - Examined the VaR and CVaR in an investment portfolio looked into by the Monte Carlo simulation

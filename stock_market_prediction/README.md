The Standard & Poor's 500 encompasses 500 corporations that have their stocks publically listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Often times, it is regarded to greatly represent trends of the United State's global market as a whole.

In this project, I aim to generate machine learning models to predict if we should buy the S&amp;P 500. Stock prices fluctuate greatly from day to day, minute to minute, and second to second. I will look into the S&P 500 dataset provided by yahoo finance to utilize valid predictors in constructing the model.

Introduced new predictors through looking at trends and how the stock price compares to the days before.
Accessed if my false positive or false negative rate is high and reconstructed my models based on this fact.
Constructed model utilizing Random Forest.
Generated prediction and backtesting function to access the accuracy of the model.

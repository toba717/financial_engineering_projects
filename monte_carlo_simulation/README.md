# monte carlo simulation 

In this project, I have simulated the performance of a stock portolio utilizing the monte carlo method.

Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model the performance of a stock portfolio over time. The process involves generating many possible scenarios for the future performance of the individual stocks in the portfolio, and then using these scenarios to estimate the distribution of possible portfolio returns.

In a Monte Carlo simulation of a stock portfolio, it is important to account for the correlations between the stocks because these correlations can have a significant impact on the risk and return of the portfolio.

If the stocks in a portfolio are perfectly correlated, meaning that they move in lockstep with each other, the portfolio will be more sensitive to changes in the overall market. On the other hand, if the stocks are uncorrelated or negatively correlated, the portfolio will be less sensitive to market movements and may be less risky.

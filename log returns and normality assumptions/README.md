# log_returns_and_normality_assumptions

Simple returns and log returns are two different ways of calculating returns on an investment.

Simple returns are calculated by taking the difference between the ending value of an investment and the beginning value, divided by the beginning value. For example, if you invest $100 and at the end of the period the investment is worth $110, the simple return would be (110 - 100) / 100 = 10%.

Log returns, on the other hand, are calculated using the natural logarithm of the ending value divided by the beginning value. Log returns are useful because they allow you to calculate the compound return on an investment over multiple periods. For example, if you have an investment that returns 10% in one period and 20% in another period, the compound return using simple returns would be 30%, but using log returns the compound return would be something different.

Overall, log returns are often preferred to simple returns because they are additive, meaning that you can simply add up the log returns for each period to get the total compound return. Simple returns are not additive in this way, so they are not as useful for comparing returns over multiple periods.

I initially assessed the difference between simple and log return and further determined if the normality assumption holds for this financial data. I have done this through visual and quantitative analysis. I have generated two plots to visually represent if the data is normally distributed and further looked into two types of hypothesis tests.
